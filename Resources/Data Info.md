About: Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 160k+ Tracks
       Audio features of 160k+ songs released in between 1921 and 2020

Context
As a self-taught data scientist and music enthusiast, I always wanted to do some scientific research using Spotify Web API. Later as I found out that there was no up-to-date and large-scale dataset, I decided to create it on my own.

Content
The "data.csv" file contains more than 160.000 songs collected from Spotify Web API, and also you can find data grouped by artist, year, or genre in the data section.

I would thank to Spotify Developers website for creating a very good documentation for Spotify Web API, Spotipy (Python module for Spotify web servers) for making the requesting process more flexible, and I want to especially thank to Kaggle Community for allowing me the opportunity to share this project!
